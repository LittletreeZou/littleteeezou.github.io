I am currently a 3rd year master's student at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), supervised by Prof. [Jiajun Zhang](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/jjzhang.htm). And I also work closely with Prof. [Shaonan Wang](https://wangshaonan.github.io) and Prof. [Chengqing Zong](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/english/zong.htm) at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). I hold a bachelor's degree in Statistics from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). In 2022 Fall, I will join Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in UAE as a PhD student. 

Research Interests
======
I have broad interests in AI and cognitive science. My current research falls in the cross-domain of NLP and cognitive neuroscience, focusing on decoding language from functional brain images.
